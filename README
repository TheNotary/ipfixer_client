Ah, the old ipfixer client to be run on a windows machine.  

==Fresh Install Sequence (~winxp or winvista)==

1)  Install git (just to download)
http://git-scm.com/download/win

2)  Install ruby and then devkit 
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

Devkit:  Extract to c:/devkit and then run c:/devkit/msys.bat


    $  cd /c/devkit
    $  ruby dk.rb init; ruby dk.rb install


3)  Clone the repo to desired location

    $  cd dev  # make a directory for development...
    $  git clone https://github.com/TheNotary/ipfixer_client.git
    $  cd ipfixer_client

4)  Install bundler, and then install the bundle for this gem

    $  gem install ruby-debug19 # due to bugs, do this...
    # it will fail, but that's fine and allows us to install debugger-linecache thereafter...
    # maybe it just needs linecache19 and possibly... ruby-debug-base19-0.11.25??
    $  gem install bundler
    $  bundle install


5)  Install the gem intself

    $  bundle exec rake install


6)  Install the windows service (run cmd as admin on vista... win_key -> 'cmd' -> Ctrl+shft+enter)

    $  ipfixer install

It will prompt you to enter: 
  -An ipfixes server (I'll make the rails generator shortly and put it online)
  -A port on which your server runs
  -An optional dynamic dns URL that it will GET when ever it detects an IP change
  -Someday, a security token that allows you to authenticate with your ipfixer server

A configuration file can be created... at `c:/it/ipfixer/ipfixer.conf`  It can be modified at any time.  

7)  Now start the service using computer management.  (sry, i'm in a rush...)








ToDo:
-Add error handling for when the IP Address isn't returning a valid IP (I think it just mysteriously crashes)
-Add error/ usability handling if PORT or SERVER isn't specified in the yaml.  
-Add a command to start the windows service you lazy bum!
-Consider creating a rails engine and actually sharing this code!
-Add security token to be read from the yaml file
