Ah, the old ipfixer client to be run on a windows machine...

Have you ever wanted to keep track of one or more remote machines?  Yet their IP addresses are always subject to change?  Well this gem is designed to work with the ipfixer_server to store it's latest IP address in a remotely accessible rails application.  

The ipfixer_service runs on windows machines as a service (so it's always running as long as the PC is on, even if you're logged out).  You can view a list of currently running services by right clicking "My Computer" and selecting "manage".  Then go to...

Services and Applications -> Services

And you will see a list of services currently installed on your PC.  Following the below procedure will install a service named "ipfixer_svc"



==Fresh Install Sequence (~winxp or winvista)==

1)  Install git (just to download)
http://git-scm.com/download/win

2)  Install ruby 1.9.3 and then devkit (use the tdm devkit for 1.9.x!!)
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

    
    rubyinstaller.exe /verysilent /tasks="addtk,assocfiles,modpath"


Devkit:  Extract to c:/devkit and then run c:/devkit/msys.bat


    $  cd /c/devkit
    $  ruby dk.rb init; ruby dk.rb install


3)  Clone the repo to desired location

    $  cd dev  # make a directory for development...
    $  git clone https://github.com/TheNotary/ipfixer_client.git
    $  cd ipfixer_client

4)  Install bundler, and then install the bundle for this gem

    $  gem install ruby-debug19 # due to bugs, do this...
    # it will fail, but that's fine and allows us to install debugger-linecache thereafter...
    # maybe it just needs linecache19 and possibly... ruby-debug-base19-0.11.25??
    $  gem install bundler
    $  bundle install


5)  Install the gem intself

    $  bundle exec rake install


6)  Install the windows service (run cmd as admin on vista... win_key -> 'cmd' -> Ctrl+shft+enter)

    $  ipfixer install

It will prompt you to enter: 
  -An ipfixes server (I'll make the rails generator shortly and put it online)
  -A port on which your server runs
  -An optional dynamic dns URL that it will GET when ever it detects an IP change
  -Someday, a security token that allows you to authenticate with your ipfixer server

A configuration file can be created... at `c:/it/ipfixer/ipfixer.conf`  It can be modified at any time.  

7)  Now start the service using computer management.  (sry, i'm in a rush...)
