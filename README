Ah, the old ipfixer client to be run on a windows machine.  

use `$  ipfixer install` to install the windows service on your system.  It will prompt for a server to post the IP address to, you know what to do there I hope.  

You'll have to manually start the service the first time.


A configuration file can be created... at c:/it/ipfixer/ipfixer.conf


ToDo:
-Add error handling for when the IP Address isn't returning a valid IP (I think it just mysteriously crashes)
-Add error/ usability handling if PORT or SERVER isn't specified in the yaml.  I think those constants need to get set to nil in that case explicitly, otherwise it will crash mysteriously...
-Add a command to start the windows service you lazy bum!
-Consider creating a rails engine and actually sharing this code instead of being a douche!
