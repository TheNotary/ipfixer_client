Ah, the old ipfixer client.  It will install to c:/it/ipfixer
It basically copies everything in lib/ to that directory.  
It will register a service with the windows machine it's installed in.  Uninstall will reverse the operation.  

A configuration file can be created... at c:/it/ipfixer/ipfixer.conf
