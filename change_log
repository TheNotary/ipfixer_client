==version 0.0.1==

Built the app.  This version spans many months, I think even years.  I didn't think about change logs that far back, but am starting to now...  The early version so of 0.0.1 didn't work; the latest version of 0.0.1, worked and was bumpted to version 0.0.2 to give me some practice...
